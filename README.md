Description:<br/>
This project was built as a Tutorial/Learning project that creates a decentralized lottery smart contract. This smart contract allows multiple users to deposit funds onto this contract as entry into the raffle. After the alloted time interval the raffle will close, randomize a winner using Chainlink VRF, and transfer the entire balance of the smart contract to the winner.
