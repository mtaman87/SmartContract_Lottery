Description:<br/>
This project was built as a Tutorial/Learning project that creates a decentralized lottery smart contract. This smart contract allows a user to deposit funds onto the contract to enter the raffle and after the alloted time interval the raffle will close, randomize a winner using Chainlink VRF, and transfer the entire balance of the smart contract to the winner.
